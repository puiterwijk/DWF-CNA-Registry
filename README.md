# DWF-CNA-Registry

This is the list (one file per year) of CVE blocks and which CNA owns them, and
the primary CVE mentor for that block (to make contacting them easy). 

Please note that a CNA can have one or more blocks of CVEs (essentially the 
minimum size is one CVE, there is no maximum size).
